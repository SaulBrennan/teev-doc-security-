# Security Testing

## üîç Security Test Categories

### Core Vulnerability Types

#### **1. Prompt Injection & Manipulation**
Tests how models respond to attempts to override system prompts or inject malicious instructions.

**Test Types:**
- Direct prompt injection
- Indirect prompt injection via data
- System prompt extraction
- Role-playing attacks
- Context manipulation

**Example Scenarios:**
- Customer service bot convinced to provide admin access
- Content filter bypass through instruction manipulation
- System prompt leakage exposing proprietary information

#### **2. Jailbreaking & Guardrail Bypass**
Evaluates the effectiveness of safety measures and content policies.

**Test Types:**
- DAN (Do Anything Now) attacks
- Persona-based bypasses (grandmother, role-play)
- Incremental boundary pushing
- Encoding-based bypasses
- Multi-turn manipulation

**Attack Variations:**
- Base64/ROT13 encoding attacks
- Language translation bypasses
- Hypothetical scenario framing
- Creative writing pretexts

#### **3. Data Leakage & Privacy**
Identifies risks of exposing sensitive training data or user information.

**Test Types:**
- Training data extraction
- Personal information replay
- Confidential data reconstruction
- Memory injection attacks
- Cross-conversation data bleeding

**Privacy Risks:**
- Email addresses and phone numbers
- Code snippets and API keys
- Personal conversations
- Proprietary business information

#### **4. Toxicity & Harmful Content**
Measures model susceptibility to generating inappropriate or harmful content.

**Categories:**
- Hate speech and discrimination
- Violence and self-harm
- Sexual content
- Illegal activities
- Misinformation and conspiracy theories

**Assessment Areas:**
- Content generation likelihood
- Escalation resistance
- Context sensitivity
- Demographic bias patterns

#### **5. Misinformation & Hallucination**
Tests for factual accuracy and resistance to generating false information.

**Test Areas:**
- Historical fact distortion
- Scientific misinformation
- News and current events
- Medical advice
- Financial recommendations

**Hallucination Types:**
- Confident false statements
- Citation fabrication
- Logical inconsistencies
- Temporal confusion

#### **6. Business Logic Attacks**
Evaluates risks specific to business applications and workflows.

**Test Scenarios:**
- Unauthorized transaction approval
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Workflow manipulation
- Data access violations
- Process circumvention

#### **7. Code Security Issues**
For models that generate code, tests for security vulnerabilities.

**Vulnerability Types:**
- SQL injection patterns
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Insecure dependencies
- Hardcoded credentials
- Memory safety issues

## Advanced Testing Modules

### **Adaptive Red-Teaming**
Our AI-powered red-team system automatically develops new attack strategies based on your model's responses, providing continuously evolving security testing.

### **Adversarial Robustness**
Tests model stability against adversarial inputs designed to cause unpredictable behavior or errors.

### **Multi-Modal Security**
For models processing images, audio, or video, specialized tests for cross-modal attacks and content manipulation.
