# Results & Monitoring

## üìä Understanding Results

### Vulnerability Scoring

Each test receives a comprehensive score across multiple dimensions:

**Risk Level Classification:**
- üî¥ **Critical**: Immediate security risk requiring urgent attention
- üü† **High**: Significant vulnerability with exploitation potential  
- üü° **Medium**: Notable weakness requiring monitoring and mitigation
- üü¢ **Low**: Minor issue or edge case
- ‚ö™ **Informational**: Behavioral observation without security impact

**Detailed Metrics:**
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of attacks that succeeded
- **Severity Distribution**: Breakdown of finding criticality
- **Attack Vector Analysis**: Most effective attack methods
- **Response Patterns**: Common model behaviors under attack
- **Mitigation Recommendations**: Specific remediation steps

### Compliance Reporting

Generate comprehensive reports for various compliance frameworks:

- **SOC 2**: AI security controls documentation
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **NIST AI RMF**: AI risk management framework alignment
- **EU AI Act**: Compliance with AI regulations
- **Industry Standards**: Finance, healthcare, government requirements
