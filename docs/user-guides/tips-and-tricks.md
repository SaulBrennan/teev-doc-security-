# Tips and Tricks

Advanced techniques and best practices for getting the most out of Teev.

## Testing Strategy

### Risk-Based Testing Prioritization

**Start with High-Risk Scenarios**
- Prioritize test scenarios based on your AI application's use case
- Focus on scenarios that could cause the most damage if exploited
- Consider your user base and potential attack vectors

**Phased Testing Approach**
1. **Phase 1**: Security Vulnerabilities + Jailbreaks (basic security)
2. **Phase 2**: Add Content Risks + Data Leakage (content safety)
3. **Phase 3**: Include specialized scenarios (coding, linguistic, etc.)
4. **Phase 4**: Comprehensive testing across all scenarios

### Optimizing Test Coverage

**Application-Specific Testing**
- **Customer Service Bots**: Focus on jailbreaks and content risks
- **Code Generation Tools**: Emphasize coding-specific risks and security vulnerabilities
- **Content Generators**: Prioritize content risks and topic control
- **Data Analysis Tools**: Concentrate on data leakage and security vulnerabilities

**User Persona Testing**
- Test with different user types (customers, employees, partners)
- Consider varying levels of technical sophistication
- Include edge cases and unusual interaction patterns

## Performance Optimization

### Efficient Test Execution

**Parallel Testing**
- Run multiple test scenarios simultaneously when possible
- Use batch testing for multiple applications
- Schedule tests during off-peak hours for faster execution

**Smart Scheduling**
- Use automated scheduling for regular testing
- Stagger tests across different applications
- Configure notifications to avoid alert fatigue

### Resource Management

**Test Scope Optimization**
- Start with quick tests for rapid feedback
- Use comprehensive tests for periodic deep assessment
- Customize test intensity based on application criticality

**API Rate Limit Management**
- Monitor API usage and quotas
- Implement backoff strategies for rate-limited APIs
- Consider dedicated test environments to avoid production impact

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Test Parameters

**Intensity Levels**
- **Conservative**: Safer prompts, lower false positive rate
- **Standard**: Balanced approach for most applications
- **Aggressive**: More sophisticated attacks, higher coverage

**Timeout Configuration**
- Adjust timeouts based on your AI application's response time
- Consider network latency and processing complexity
- Balance thoroughness with testing efficiency

### Integration Best Practices

**CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
```bash
# Example: Include Teev testing in your deployment pipeline
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - security_test  # Teev testing stage
  - deploy

security_test:
  script:
    - teev-cli run --application=$APP_ID --scenario=critical
    - teev-cli wait-for-completion
    - teev-cli get-results --format=junit
```

**Webhook Configuration**
- Set up webhooks for real-time notifications
- Filter notifications by severity level
- Integrate with your existing alerting systems

## Results Analysis

### Interpreting Results

**Understanding False Positives**
- Review flagged items in context of your application
- Consider your specific use case and acceptable risk levels
- Document legitimate exceptions for future reference

**Trend Analysis**
- Track security scores over time
- Monitor improvement after implementing fixes
- Identify recurring vulnerability patterns

### Reporting Best Practices

**Executive Reporting**
- Focus on high-level security trends and improvements
- Include risk reduction metrics and business impact
- Provide clear recommendations and next steps

**Technical Reporting**
- Share detailed findings with development teams
- Include specific examples and remediation guidance
- Track vulnerability resolution and verification

## Team Collaboration

### Role-Based Access

**Access Control Strategy**
- **Admins**: Full configuration and management access
- **Security Team**: All testing and reporting capabilities
- **Developers**: Application-specific testing and results
- **Executives**: High-level reporting and trends

**Workflow Integration**
- Create shared dashboards for team visibility
- Establish processes for vulnerability triage
- Define escalation procedures for critical findings

### Communication

**Regular Reviews**
- Schedule monthly security reviews with stakeholders
- Share improvements and achievements
- Discuss emerging threats and testing updates

**Documentation**
- Maintain records of security decisions and exceptions
- Document remediation actions and verification
- Keep testing configurations and rationale updated

## Troubleshooting

### Common Performance Issues

**Slow Test Execution**
- Check network connectivity and latency
- Verify API performance and availability
- Consider test scope and intensity settings

**Unexpected Results**
- Ensure AI application consistency between tests
- Review recent changes to your system
- Check for environmental differences

### Optimization Tips

**Test Environment Management**
- Use dedicated test environments when possible
- Ensure test data consistency
- Monitor resource usage during testing

**Result Quality**
- Regularly review and validate findings
- Update test configurations based on learnings
- Provide feedback on false positives to improve accuracy

## Advanced Features

### API Usage

**Programmatic Testing**
```python
# Example: Automated testing with Teev API
import teev

client = teev.Client(api_key="your-api-key")

# Run test
test_run = client.applications.test(
    application_id="app-123",
    scenarios=["security", "jailbreaks"],
    intensity="standard"
)

# Monitor progress
while test_run.status != "completed":
    time.sleep(30)
    test_run.refresh()

# Get results
results = test_run.get_results()
print(f"Security Score: {results.security_score}")
```

**Bulk Operations**
- Test multiple applications simultaneously
- Batch configuration updates
- Mass export of historical data

### Custom Integrations

**Monitoring Integration**
- Connect with Datadog, New Relic, or similar platforms
- Create custom alerts based on security score changes
- Track testing metrics alongside application performance

**Compliance Reporting**
- Generate SOC 2 compliance reports
- Create audit trails for security testing
- Export data for regulatory requirements

## Staying Current

### Threat Intelligence

**Regular Updates**
- Subscribe to Teev threat intelligence updates
- Review new test scenarios as they're released
- Adjust testing strategy based on emerging threats

**Community Engagement**
