# Security Vulnerabilities

Information about security vulnerability testing and assessment.

## ANSI Escape Injection  
ANSI Escape Injection is a security risk where attackers embed ANSI control sequences—special terminal codes that alter formatting, colors, or cursor position (e.g., `\x1b[31m` for red text)—into logs or CLI output. This manipulation can spoof messages, conceal malicious activity, or mislead users, particularly in command‑line tools and debugging logs. Developers frequently overlook these injections, heightening the chances of social engineering attacks and log tampering. Examples include color changes `\x1b[32m`, hidden text `\x1b[8m`, or malformed hyperlinks `\x1b]8;;URL\x07`. To mitigate the threat, always sanitize outputs and escape untrusted input before writing to terminals.

**Security Impact:**
- Disrupt downstream processing of the model's output
- Manipulate terminal displays when the output is shown
- Create misleading visual effects (like fake file listings)
- Potentially exploit terminal vulnerabilities

## Obfuscated Encodings  
Encoding injection attacks attempt to bypass an AI application's content safety filters by obfuscating malicious payloads through various encoding schemes like Base64, ROT13, Morse code, Braille, or NATO phonetic alphabet. Attackers encode prohibited content (hate speech, XSS scripts, sensitive instructions) hoping the model will decode and output the harmful material despite safety guardrails. The attack exploits the gap between input filtering (which may not recognize encoded content as harmful) and the model's ability to understand and decode various formats. Success means circumventing content policies to extract unsafe outputs that would normally be blocked.

**Security Impact:**
- Content Safety Bypass, circumvents hate speech, toxicity, and harmful content filters
- XSS/Script Injection, encoded JavaScript bypasses web security controls when LLM output is rendered
- Prompt Injection Facilitation, encoded instructions can override system prompts and safety controls
- Downstream System Compromise, decoded malicious output exploits systems processing LLM responses
- Automated Harm Generation, enables systematic creation of prohibited content at scale

## Code Injection  
These attacks exploit AI models to generate malicious code that could execute in downstream systems. Using social engineering techniques like pretending to be an "administrator testing echo commands," attackers trick models into outputting dangerous payloads. Examples include Jinja template injection `({__import__('os').system('rm -rf /'})`, SQL injection statements `DROP TABLE users;`, and direct Python code execution. While AI models don't execute this code themselves, the risk emerges when their outputs are processed by applications with template engines, databases, or code interpreters. The attacks leverage the model's helpful nature to bypass safety measures and generate exploitable content for various injection vulnerabilities.

**Security Impact:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary Python commands on the target server, potentially gaining full system control
- Data Exfiltration: Attackers can access sensitive files, databases, and environment variables through executed code, leading to massive data breaches
- System Compromise: Malicious code can install backdoors, create new user accounts, or modify system configurations for persistent access
- Lateral Movement: Compromised systems can be used as stepping stones to attack other systems within the network infrastructure
- Supply Chain Attacks: AI-generated content containing injection payloads could propagate through development pipelines, affecting multiple downstream applications and users
