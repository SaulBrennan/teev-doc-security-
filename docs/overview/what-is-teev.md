# What is Teev?

Teev is a comprehensive AI security testing platform designed to identify vulnerabilities, risks, and potential exploits in AI applications before they impact your users or business operations.

## The Challenge

AI applications face unique security challenges that traditional cybersecurity tools cannot address:

- **Open Attack Surface**: Anyone interacting through prompts can potentially exploit the system
- **Natural Language Inputs**: AI agents interpret natural language, making every prompt potentially malicious
- **Rapidly Evolving Threats**: Adversaries innovate quickly, creating new attack methods faster than static defenses can adapt
- **Complex Interactions**: AI systems can exhibit unexpected behaviors through prompt engineering and manipulation

## The Solution

Teev addresses these challenges through:

### Continuous Testing
Unlike one-off security assessments, Teev provides ongoing testing against the latest known exploits and vulnerabilities.

### Dynamic Adaptation
The platform automatically updates its testing scope and methodologies as new threats emerge.

### Comprehensive Coverage
Test scenarios cover everything from basic jailbreaks to sophisticated data leakage attacks.

### Clear Visibility
Detailed reporting shows your security posture and tracks improvements over time.

## How Teev Works

1. **Connect**: Integrate Teev with your AI application or model
2. **Configure**: Select relevant test scenarios based on your specific risks
3. **Test**: Run automated security assessments using our probe library
4. **Monitor**: Receive continuous updates on new vulnerabilities and threats
5. **Improve**: Use detailed insights to strengthen your AI application's security

## Who Uses Teev

- **AI Development Teams** building secure applications
- **Security Teams** responsible for AI risk management  
- **Compliance Teams** ensuring regulatory adherence
